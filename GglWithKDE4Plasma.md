Ever since the beginning of Google Gadgets for Linux, the developers of GGL have made up their minds to work as closely as possible with other Open Source projects. Now I am glad to introduce you the integration of GGL into KDE4's plasma.


# Screenshots #

First of all, sweet screenshots. The first one shows four gadgets running on plasma desktop. The second one shows the same four gadgets running on plasma's vertical panel. The third one shows three gadgets running on plasma's horizontal panel.

# Where can I get it #

Do these screenshots look great? Wanna give it a try?

Currently GGL on plasma is part of kdebase and will be released with KDE4.2 on January 27th, 2009. If you can't wait that long, you can build it yourself right now. Here is a [tutorial](http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/KDE4) from KDE's site teaching you how to build KDE4.
